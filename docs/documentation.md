# Documentation

This documentation you're reading now is build with [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/)

The whole documentation is part of the Shopify-starter repo, and with this included in your project when creating a theme based on this repo.

## A bit meta, but.

If you feel frisky you can preview the local version of the documentation by running

```sh
pnpm run docs:dev
```

and add/update sections and pages, if you'd like to document your own project.

To get the documentation deployed to Github Pages you can follow the official [guide](https://vitepress.dev/guide/deploy#github-pages), where step 1 is already done.
