# Theme settings

There's a few Shopify Theme Settings included as schema fields. Feel free to remove the fields from `config/settings_schema.json`, if they aren't relevant to your project.

## Favicons

The theme is setup with a dark and a light favicon.

## Browser theme color

A color string defining the color of the browser UI, mainly on mobile browsers.

## Color schemes

Depending on the projects need for colors, you should define and name the amount of colors in the settings_schema.json, under "Colors".

The theme's predefined to handle text-, background-, primary- and secondary colors. But add/remove as needed.
