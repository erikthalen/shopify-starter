[Documentation](https://erikthalen.github.io/shopify-starter/)

## Theme settings

The theme is setup with a dark and a light favicon, and a browser color theme. This is edited in theme settings.

Depending on the projects need for colors, you should define and name the amount of colors in the settings_schema.json, under "Colors". The theme's predefined to handle text-, background-, primary- and secondary colors. But add/remove as needed.
